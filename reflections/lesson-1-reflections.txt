How hard was it ?

Easy

How do you feel about your code ?

Fairly well, I spent a bit of time making this assignment just for fun, and sent it to a bunch of friends to bug them. Had lots of fun with this one. In terms of difficulty, it was fairly easy to create a web app of this caliber, due to my previous javascript experience. I hope there are more challenging projects on this course moving forward. 

How many times have you clicked your cat?

Over 9000.

How hard was it ?

Medium.

How do you feel about your code ?

I think I could be more efficient on creating this project purely through javascript if that was the assignemnt from the start. Since it wasn't, I used a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JS solutions to get the job done efficiently. I am trying to use mostly javscript for this course, as I am much more experienced with jQuery, and need the practice using vanialla JS to better learn how other JS libraries other from jQuery work. Avoiding dom re-parsing is much easier to do with jQuery; with JS, I had to learn how to apply event listeners to my code, initially using a window.load function which did not work to well. I could have created this entire app in javascript using event listeners, but since the original assignment did not require it, it would be inefficient to re-create the entire project purely in JS. I would have created a more efficient, and advanced cat duplication method than I did this time around. 

Happy with your cat duplication ?

No.

How many times have you clicked your cat?

Over 9000.

How hard was it ?

Hard.

How do you feel about your code ?

I feel very happy with the solution I came up with. I spend a lot of time on this one,(6+ hours) playing around with many solutions, some not scalable at all, others much more scalable. I used the forumn, stack overflow, wc3, and previous experience with JS to come up with a solid solution to this project. 

Happy with your cat duplication ?

Yes. It is efficient, and scalable. I do not have to copy lots of lines of HTML in order to generate the code I want, instead I can change 3 lines of javascript code to generate a single cat. 

How many times have you clicked your cat?

Over 18000.

Are you happy with your code?

Very. Although there can be some fixes, I am very happy with the end result of my code for this iteration of the assignment. 

Are here any problems you can forsee with it?

I will have a much harder time adding more html structure to the app if I want to keep generating most HTML via JS code instead of static HTML. It takes alot more time to write code to dynamically generate HTML than to actually write the code in HTML instead. 

What would happen if I asked you for more changes?

I would be delighted to deliver more changes to this app. I have learned a TREMENDOUS amount on code structure and scalability just from this assignment alone.
