How hard was it ?

Easy

How do you feel about your code ?

Fairly well, I spent a bit of time making this assignment just for fun, and sent it to a bunch of friends to bug them. Had lots of fun with this one. In terms of difficulty, it was fairly easy to create a web app of this caliber, due to my previous javascript experience. I hope there are more challenging projects on this course moving forward.
