How do you feel about your code ?

Fairly well, I spent a bit of time making this assignment just for fun, and sent it to a bunch of friends to bug them. Had lots of fun with this one. In terms of difficulty, it was fairly easy to create a web app of this caliber, due to my previous javascript experience. I hope there are more challenging projects on this course moving forward.

Medium.

How do you feel about your code ?

I think I could be more efficient on creating this project purely through javascript if that was the assignemnt from the start. Since it wasn't, I used a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JS solutions to get the job done efficiently. I am trying to use mostly javscript for this course, as I am much more experienced with jQuery, and need the practice using vanialla JS to better learn how other JS libraries other from jQuery work. Avoiding dom re-parsing is much easier to do with jQuery; with JS, I had to learn how to apply event listeners to my code, initially using a window.load function which did not work to well. I could have created this entire app in javascript using event listeners, but since the original assignment did not require it, it would be inefficient to re-create the entire project purely in JS. I would have created a more efficient, and advanced cat duplication method than I did this time around. 

Happy with your cat duplication ?

No.
